pain opioid prescription should be patient specific and limited to cases in which other treatments are insufficient and criteria for opioid use are met see below harms may inadequately treat severe subacute or chronic pain benefits less debility fewer adverse effects reduced accident risks lower risks of dependency addiction overdoses and deaths strength of evidence moderately not recommended evidence b level of confidence high indications patients should meet all of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals are not met cdc opioids should only be continued beyond the opioids trial period if both goals are met and these outweigh risks to patient safety cdc assessment of function and pain at least monthly in the first months of treatment and then quarterly should be documented there should be at least improvement in both pain and

treatments have been documented to have failed be engaged in an ongoing active exercise program and comply with that prescription be prescribed a non opioid prescription s e g nsaids acetaminophen absent a contraindication such non opioids should nearly always be the primary pain medication and accompany an opioid prescription cdc the lowest effective dose should be used weaker opioids should be used whenever possible meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain due to bioaccumulation and adverse effects low dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the adverse risks of opioids dispensing should be only what is needed to treat the pain vii patients should be periodically reminded to not take benzodiazepines alcohol diphenhydramine included in many otc medications other sleep medication or use other sedating medications patients should be educated on the proper storage and disposal of opioids at the time of the initial prescription and at every visit as secondary fatalities from misuse and accidental poisonings of children are common if an opioids trial is successful and there is a decision to transition to long term opioids extended release long acting opioids may be selectively used long acting opioids should be used on a scheduled basis rather than as needed prescription databases usually referred to as pdmp should be checked for conflicting opioid prescriptions from other providers or evidence of misreporting due to greater than fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death considerable caution is warranted among those

reduced accident risks lower risks of dependency addiction overdoses and deaths strength of evidence moderately not recommended evidence b level of confidence high indications patients should meet all of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals

conflicting opioid prescriptions from other providers or evidence of misreporting due to greater than fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death considerable caution is warranted among those

used as a cough suppressant it is used as a single agent or in combination with acetaminophen tylenol with codeine and other products for treatment of mild to moderate pain regarding opioid in general the odg does not recommend the use of opioids except for short use for severe cases not to exceed weeks this request alone exceeds the week recommended treatment length for opioid usage ca mtus does not discourage use of opioids past weeks but does state that ongoing review and documentation of pain relief functional status appropriate medication use and side effects is required for sustained use ca mtus further states several methods are used for tracking pain and function to provide valid comparisons pain and function should be consistently tracked with the same validated instruments each time providers should not rely solely on informal inquiry or observation physical therapy notes and similar nonstandard and scientifically unvalidated methods because they are unreliable and lead to inconsistent tracking of effectiveness across practice types and systems in order to track pain intensity most guidelines rely on a point scale such as a numerical rating scale or visual analog scale the most valid and consistent method for tracking function is to routinely measure physical function by documenting actual physical performance including exertional capacity degree of flexibility and improved strength the available medical record does not fully document any valid consistent objective findings to include improved performance strength or flexibility to indicate functional

ur determination imr evidence cited mtus neck and upper back complaints guidelines section s surgical considerations imr rationale accordingly to the mtus epidural steroid injections are recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain defined as pain in dermatome distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy see specific criteria for use below most current guidelines recommend no more than esi injections this is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a series of three esis these early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence research has now shown that on average less than two injections are required for a successful esi outcome current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection and a third esi is rarely recommended epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts including continuing a home exercise program there is little information on improved function the american academy of neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between and weeks following the injection but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long term pain relief beyond months and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain armon see also epidural steroid injections series of three criteria for the use of epidural steroid injections note the purpose of esi is to reduce pain and inflammation restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs and avoiding surgery but this treatment alone offers no significant long term functional benefit radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and or electrodiagnostic testing initially unresponsive to conservative treatment exercises physical methods nsaids and muscle relaxants injections should be performed using fluoroscopy live x ray for guidance if used for diagnostic purposes a maximum of two injections should be performed a second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections no more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks no more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session in the therapeutic phase repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement including at least pain relief with associated reduction of medication use for six to eight weeks with a general recommendation of no more than blocks per region per year manchikanti boswell current research does not support a series of three

determination imr evidence cited non mtus official disability guidelines sedation imr rationale sedation there is no evidence based literature to make a firm recommendation as to sedation during an esi the use of sedation introduces some potential diagnostic and safety issues making unnecessary use less than ideal a major concern is that sedation may result in the inability of the patient to experience the expected pain and paresthesias associated with spinal cord irritation this is of concern in the cervical region hodges routine use is not recommended except for patients with anxiety the least amount of sedation for the shortest duration of effect is recommended the general agent recommended is a benzodiazepine trentman kim cuccuzzella while sedation is not recommended for facet injections especially with opioids because it may alter the anesthetic diagnostic response sedation is not generally necessary for an esi but is not contraindicated as far as monitored anesthesia care mac administered by someone besides the surgeon there should be evidence of a pre anesthetic exam and evaluation prescription of anesthesia care completion of the record administration of medication and provision of post op care supervision services provided by the operating physician are considered part of the surgical service provided according to the documents available for review there is no

hydration by drinking enough water and advising the patient to follow a proper diet rich in fiber these can reduce the chance and severity of opioid induced constipation and constipation in general in addition some laxatives may help to stimulate gastric motility other over the counter medications can help loosen otherwise hard stools add bulk and increase water content of the stool there is no

to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals are not met cdc opioids should only be continued beyond the opioids trial period if both goals are met and these outweigh risks

meaningful improvement of pain and function non mtus official disability guidelines pain chronic tylenol with codeine opioids imr rationale ca mtus and the odg state regarding codeine recommended as an option for mild to moderate pain as indicated below codeine is a schedule c ii controlled substance it is similar to morphine mg of codeine is similar in potency to mg of acetaminophen it is widely used as a cough suppressant it is used as a single agent or in combination with acetaminophen tylenol with codeine and other products for treatment of mild to moderate pain regarding opioid in general the odg does not recommend the use of opioids except for short use for severe cases not to exceed weeks this request alone exceeds the week recommended treatment length for opioid usage ca mtus does not discourage use of opioids past weeks but does state that ongoing review and documentation of pain relief functional status appropriate medication use and side effects is required for sustained use ca mtus further states several methods are used for tracking pain and function to provide valid comparisons pain and function should be consistently tracked with the same validated instruments each time providers should not rely solely on informal inquiry or observation physical therapy notes and similar nonstandard and scientifically unvalidated methods because they are unreliable and lead to inconsistent tracking of effectiveness across practice types and systems in order to track pain intensity most guidelines rely on a point scale such as a numerical rating scale or visual analog scale the most valid and consistent method for tracking function is to routinely measure physical function by documenting actual physical performance including exertional capacity degree of flexibility and improved strength the available medical record does not fully document any valid consistent objective findings to include improved performance strength or flexibility to indicate functional improvement with the use of this medication as such the request for tylenol no with refills is not medically necessary this decision addresses the medical necessity of opioids as they have been

on a federal level it has been suggested that the main effect is due to generalized sedation and treatment of anxiety abuse has been noted for sedative and relaxant effects in regular abusers the main concern is the accumulation of meprobamate carisoprodol abuse has also been noted to augment or alter effects of other drugs the odg states that soma is not recommended this medication is fda approved for symptomatic relief of discomfort associated with acute pain in musculoskeletal conditions as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy ahfs this medication is not indicated for long term use this

major depressive disorder the ahrq comparative effectiveness research on insomnia concludes that trazodone is equal to zolpidem ahrq however evidence for the off label use of trazodone for treatment of insomnia is weak the current recommendation is to utilize a combined pharmacologic and psychological and behavior treatment when primary insomnia is diagnosed there has been no dose finding study performed to assess the dose of trazodone for insomnia in non depressed patients other pharmacologic therapies should be recommended for primary insomnia before considering trazodone especially if the

recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain defined as pain in dermatome distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy see specific criteria for use below most current guidelines recommend no more than esi injections this is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a series of three esis these early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence research has now shown that on average less than two injections are required for a successful esi outcome current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection and a third esi is rarely recommended epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts including continuing a home exercise program there is little information on improved function the american academy of neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between and weeks following the injection but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long term pain relief beyond months and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain armon see also epidural steroid injections series of three criteria for the use of epidural steroid injections note the purpose of esi is to reduce pain and inflammation restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs and avoiding surgery but this treatment alone offers no significant long term functional benefit radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and or electrodiagnostic testing initially unresponsive to conservative treatment exercises physical methods nsaids and muscle relaxants injections should be performed using fluoroscopy live x ray for guidance if used for diagnostic purposes a maximum of two injections should be performed a second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections no more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks no more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session in the therapeutic phase repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement including at least pain

with anxiety the least amount of sedation for the shortest duration of effect is recommended the general agent recommended is a benzodiazepine trentman kim cuccuzzella while sedation is not recommended for facet injections especially with opioids because it may alter the anesthetic diagnostic response sedation is not generally necessary for an esi but is not contraindicated as far as

evidence b level of confidence high indications patients should meet all of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals are not met cdc opioids should only be continued beyond the opioids trial period if both goals are met and these outweigh risks to patient safety cdc assessment of function and pain at least monthly in the first months of treatment and then quarterly should be documented there should be at least improvement in both pain and

absent a contraindication such non opioids should nearly always be the primary pain medication and accompany an opioid prescription cdc the lowest effective dose should be used weaker opioids should be used whenever possible meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain due to bioaccumulation and adverse effects low dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the adverse risks of opioids dispensing should be only what is needed to treat the pain vii patients should be periodically reminded to not take benzodiazepines alcohol diphenhydramine included in many otc medications other sleep medication or use other sedating medications patients should be educated on the proper storage and disposal of opioids at the time of the initial prescription and at every visit as secondary fatalities from misuse and accidental poisonings of children are common if an opioids trial is successful and there is a decision to transition to long term opioids extended release long acting opioids may be selectively used long acting opioids should be used on a scheduled basis rather than as needed prescription databases usually referred to as pdmp should be checked for conflicting opioid prescriptions from other providers or evidence of misreporting due to greater than fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death considerable caution is warranted among those

of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals

conflicting opioid prescriptions from other providers or evidence of misreporting due to greater than fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death considerable caution is warranted among those

an option for mild to moderate pain as indicated below codeine is a schedule c ii controlled substance it is similar to morphine mg of codeine is similar in potency to mg of acetaminophen it is widely used as a cough suppressant it is used as a single agent or in combination with acetaminophen tylenol with codeine and other products for treatment of mild to moderate pain regarding opioid in general the odg does not recommend the use of opioids except for short use for severe cases not to exceed weeks this request alone exceeds the week recommended treatment length for opioid usage ca mtus does not discourage use of opioids past weeks but does state that ongoing review and documentation of pain relief functional status appropriate medication use and side effects is required for sustained use ca mtus further states several methods are used for tracking pain and function to provide valid comparisons pain and function should be consistently tracked with the same validated instruments each time providers should not rely solely on informal inquiry or observation physical therapy notes and similar nonstandard and scientifically unvalidated methods because they are unreliable and lead to inconsistent tracking of effectiveness across practice types and systems in order to track pain intensity most guidelines rely on a point scale such as a numerical rating scale or visual analog scale the most valid and consistent method for tracking function is to routinely measure physical function by documenting actual physical performance including exertional capacity degree of flexibility and improved strength the available medical record does not fully document any valid consistent objective findings to include improved performance strength or flexibility to indicate functional

recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain defined as pain in dermatome distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy see specific criteria for use below most current guidelines recommend no more than esi injections this is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a series of three esis these early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence research has now shown that on average less than two injections are required for a successful esi outcome current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection and a third esi is rarely recommended epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts including continuing a home exercise program there is little information on improved function the american academy of neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between and weeks following the injection but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long term pain relief beyond months and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain armon see also epidural steroid injections series of three criteria for the use of epidural steroid injections note the purpose of esi is to reduce pain and inflammation restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs and avoiding surgery but this treatment alone offers no significant long term functional benefit radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and or electrodiagnostic testing initially unresponsive to conservative treatment exercises physical methods nsaids and muscle relaxants injections should be performed using fluoroscopy live x ray for guidance if used for diagnostic purposes a maximum of two injections should be performed a second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections no more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks no more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session in the therapeutic phase repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement including at least pain

with anxiety the least amount of sedation for the shortest duration of effect is recommended the general agent recommended is a benzodiazepine trentman kim cuccuzzella while sedation is not recommended for facet injections especially with opioids because it may alter the anesthetic diagnostic response sedation is not generally necessary for an esi but is not contraindicated as far as

california mtus does not recommend routine use of opiate medication to address chronic nonmalignant pain opioid use is moderately not recommended for treatment of subacute and chronic non malignant pain opioid prescription should be patient specific and limited to cases in which other treatments are insufficient and criteria for opioid use are met see below harms may inadequately treat severe subacute or chronic pain benefits less debility fewer adverse effects reduced accident risks lower risks of dependency addiction overdoses and deaths strength of evidence moderately not recommended evidence b level of confidence high indications patients should meet all of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals are not met cdc opioids should only be continued beyond the opioids trial period if both goals are met and these outweigh risks to patient safety cdc assessment of function and pain at least monthly in the first months of treatment and then quarterly should be documented there should be at least improvement in both pain and function to continue opioids treatment a severe disorder warranting potential opioid treatment is present e g crps severe radiculopathy advanced degenerative joint disease djd other more efficacious treatments have been documented to have failed be engaged in an ongoing active exercise program and comply with that prescription be prescribed a non opioid prescription s e g nsaids acetaminophen absent a contraindication such non opioids should nearly always be the primary pain medication and accompany an opioid prescription cdc the lowest effective dose should be used weaker opioids should be used whenever possible meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain due to bioaccumulation and adverse effects low dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the adverse risks of opioids dispensing should be only what is needed to treat the pain vii patients should be periodically reminded to not take benzodiazepines alcohol diphenhydramine included in many otc medications other sleep medication or use other sedating medications patients should be educated on the proper storage and disposal of opioids at the time of the initial prescription and at every visit as secondary fatalities from misuse and accidental poisonings of children are common if an opioids trial is successful and there is a decision to transition to long term opioids extended release long acting opioids may be selectively used long acting opioids should be used on a scheduled basis rather than as needed prescription databases usually referred to as pdmp should be checked for conflicting opioid prescriptions from other providers or evidence of misreporting due to greater than fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death considerable caution is warranted among those using other sedating medications and substances public copy for imr case number fdl public copy v including i benzodiazepines ii anti histamines h blockers and or iii illicit substances patients should not receive opioids if they use illicit substances unless there is objective evidence of significant trauma or at least moderate to severe injuries attempt to wean twice a year to lower than mg med if patients were previously prescribed those doses there is no current documentation of baseline pain pain score with use of opioids functional improvement on current regimen side effects or review of potentially aberrant drug taking behaviors as outlined in the mtus and as required for ongoing treatment therefore at this time the requirements for treatment have not been met and the

reduced accident risks lower risks of dependency addiction overdoses and deaths strength of evidence moderately not recommended evidence b level of confidence high indications patients should meet all of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals

pain due to bioaccumulation and adverse effects low dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the adverse risks of opioids dispensing should be only what is needed

secondary fatalities from misuse and accidental poisonings of children are common if an opioids trial is successful and there is a decision to transition to long term opioids extended release long

conflicting opioid prescriptions from other providers or evidence of misreporting due to greater than fold elevated risks of adverse effects and death considerable caution is warranted among those

the odg does not recommend the use of opioids except for short use for severe cases not to exceed weeks this request alone exceeds the week recommended treatment length for opioid usage ca mtus does not discourage use of opioids past weeks but does state that ongoing review and documentation of pain relief functional status appropriate medication use and side effects is required for sustained use ca mtus further states several methods are used for tracking pain and function to provide valid comparisons pain and function should be consistently tracked with the same validated instruments each time providers should not rely solely on informal inquiry or observation physical therapy notes and similar nonstandard and scientifically unvalidated methods because they are unreliable and lead to inconsistent tracking of effectiveness across practice types and systems in order to track pain intensity most guidelines rely on a point scale such as a numerical rating scale or visual analog scale the most valid and consistent method for tracking function is to routinely measure physical function by documenting actual physical performance including exertional capacity degree of flexibility and improved strength the available medical record does not fully document any valid consistent objective findings to include improved performance strength or flexibility to indicate functional improvement with the use of this medication as such the request for tylenol no with refills is not medically necessary this decision addresses the medical necessity of opioids as they have been

recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain defined as pain in dermatome distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy see specific criteria for use below most current guidelines recommend no more than esi injections this is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a series of three esis these early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence research has now shown that on average less than two injections are required for a successful esi outcome current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection and a third esi is rarely recommended epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts including continuing a home exercise program there is little information on improved function the american academy of neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between and weeks following the injection but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long term pain relief beyond months and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain armon see also epidural steroid injections series of three criteria for the use of epidural steroid injections note the purpose of esi is to reduce pain and inflammation restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs and avoiding surgery but this treatment alone offers no significant long term functional benefit radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and or electrodiagnostic testing initially unresponsive to conservative treatment exercises physical methods nsaids and muscle relaxants injections should be performed using fluoroscopy live x ray for guidance if used for diagnostic purposes a maximum of two injections should be performed a second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections no more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks no more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session in the therapeutic phase repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement including at least pain relief with associated reduction of medication use for six to eight weeks with a general recommendation of no more than blocks per region per year manchikanti boswell current research does not support

sedation during an esi the use of sedation introduces some potential diagnostic and safety issues making unnecessary use less than ideal a major concern is that sedation may result in the inability of

with anxiety the least amount of sedation for the shortest duration of effect is recommended the general agent recommended is a benzodiazepine trentman kim cuccuzzella while sedation is not recommended for facet injections especially with opioids because it may alter the anesthetic diagnostic response sedation is not generally necessary for an esi but is not contraindicated as far as

evidence b level of confidence high indications patients should meet all of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals are not met cdc opioids should only be continued beyond the opioids trial period if both goals are met and these outweigh risks to patient safety cdc assessment of function and pain at least monthly in the first months of treatment and then quarterly should be documented there should be at least improvement in both pain and

treatments have been documented to have failed be engaged in an ongoing active exercise program and comply with that prescription be prescribed a non opioid prescription s e g nsaids acetaminophen absent a contraindication such non opioids should nearly always be the primary pain medication and accompany an opioid prescription cdc the lowest effective dose should be used weaker opioids should be used whenever possible meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain due to bioaccumulation and adverse effects low dose opioids may be needed in the elderly who have greater susceptibility to the adverse risks of opioids dispensing should be only what is needed to treat the pain vii patients should be periodically reminded to not take benzodiazepines alcohol diphenhydramine included in many otc medications other sleep medication or use other sedating medications patients should be educated on the proper storage and disposal of opioids at the time of the initial prescription and at every visit as secondary fatalities from misuse and accidental poisonings of children are common if an opioids trial is successful and there is a decision to transition to long term opioids extended release long acting opioids may be selectively used long acting opioids should be used on a scheduled basis rather than as needed prescription databases usually referred to as pdmp should be checked for

of the following a complete history and physical should be done if not previously accomplished reduced function is attributable to the pain pain or pain scales alone are insufficient reasons both function and pain treatment goals should be established cdc before an opioid trial of to weeks is attempted before initiating opioids there should be plans for discontinuation in the event the goals

an option for mild to moderate pain as indicated below codeine is a schedule c ii controlled substance it is similar to morphine mg of codeine is similar in potency to mg of acetaminophen it is widely used as a cough suppressant it is used as a single agent or in combination with acetaminophen tylenol with codeine and other products for treatment of mild to moderate pain regarding opioid in general the odg does not recommend the use of opioids except for short use for severe cases not to exceed weeks this request alone exceeds the week recommended treatment length for opioid usage ca mtus does not discourage use of opioids past weeks but does state that ongoing review and documentation of pain relief functional status appropriate medication use and side effects is required for sustained use ca mtus further states several methods are used for tracking pain and function to provide valid comparisons pain and function should be consistently tracked with the same validated instruments each time providers should not rely solely on informal inquiry or observation physical therapy notes and similar nonstandard and scientifically unvalidated methods because they are unreliable and lead to inconsistent tracking of effectiveness across practice types and systems in order to track pain intensity most guidelines rely on a point scale such as a numerical rating scale or visual analog scale the most valid and consistent method for tracking function is to routinely measure physical function by documenting actual physical performance including exertional capacity degree of flexibility and improved strength the available medical record does not fully document any valid consistent objective findings to include improved performance strength or flexibility to indicate functional

recommended as an option for treatment of radicular pain defined as pain in dermatome distribution with corroborative findings of radiculopathy see specific criteria for use below most current guidelines recommend no more than esi injections this is in contradiction to previous generally cited recommendations for a series of three esis these early recommendations were primarily based on anecdotal evidence research has now shown that on average less than two injections are required for a successful esi outcome current recommendations suggest a second epidural injection if partial success is produced with the first injection and a third esi is rarely recommended epidural steroid injection can offer short term pain relief and use should be in conjunction with other rehab efforts including continuing a home exercise program there is little information on improved function the american academy of neurology recently concluded that epidural steroid injections may lead to an improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain between and weeks following the injection but they do not affect impairment of function or the need for surgery and do not provide long term pain relief beyond months and there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation for the use of epidural steroid injections to treat radicular cervical pain armon see also epidural steroid injections series of three criteria for the use of epidural steroid injections note the purpose of esi is to reduce pain and inflammation restoring range of motion and thereby facilitating progress in more active treatment programs and avoiding surgery but this treatment alone offers no significant long term functional benefit radiculopathy must be documented by physical examination and corroborated by imaging studies and or electrodiagnostic testing initially unresponsive to conservative treatment exercises physical methods nsaids and muscle relaxants injections should be performed using fluoroscopy live x ray for guidance if used for diagnostic purposes a maximum of two injections should be performed a second block is not recommended if there is inadequate response to the first block diagnostic blocks should be at an interval of at least one to two weeks between injections no more than two nerve root levels should be injected using transforaminal blocks no more than one interlaminar level should be injected at one session in the therapeutic phase repeat blocks should be based on continued objective documented pain and functional improvement including at least pain

with anxiety the least amount of sedation for the shortest duration of effect is recommended the general agent recommended is a benzodiazepine trentman kim cuccuzzella while sedation is not recommended for facet injections especially with opioids because it may alter the anesthetic diagnostic response sedation is not generally necessary for an esi but is not contraindicated as far as
